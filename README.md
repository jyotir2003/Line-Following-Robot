# 🤖 Line-Following Robot Project

## 📋 Project Overview
This project involves the design and construction of an autonomous line-following robot. The robot uses IR sensors to detect and follow a predefined path, powered by two gear motors and featuring an omnidirectional wheel for enhanced maneuverability.

## 🔧 Components Used
- Nano Arduino (Microcontroller)
- L298N Motor Driver
- IR Sensors
- Gear Motors (x2)
- Omnidirectional Wheel
- Arduino IDE (for programming)

## ⚙️ Functionality
The robot autonomously follows a line using IR sensors for detection. Gear motors drive the movement, while an omnidirectional wheel provides flexibility in direction changes.

## 🔍 How It Works
1. **Line Detection**: IR sensors monitor the path
2. **Signal Processing**: Nano Arduino processes sensor data
3. **Motor Control**: Arduino adjusts motor speeds via L298N driver

## 🛠️ Setup
1. Connect components according to the schematic
2. Attach the omnidirectional wheel
3. Upload code to the Nano Arduino
4. Power up and place on a track

## 💻 Code
The main control logic is located in the `Arduino_code.ino` file.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Enhance line following algorithms
- Add obstacle detection capabilities
- Optimize speed and efficiency
